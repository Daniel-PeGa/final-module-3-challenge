# Daniel Perez Garnica's Random Password Generator

This is a site to randomly generate a password that fits the parameters established by the user.

## Project Description

This is a simple project that shows prompts asking about password length, as well as other specifics of a desired random password, and based on that information, a javascript function runs over different arrays of different kinds of characters to design the one perfect for you.

## Technologies used

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Future development

I was thinking it'd be kind of cool to have it so that if you click on top of the text of your new randomly-generated password, it gets copied, so that you only have to paste it now.

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
